# Laboratory Activity #5: Receiving serial connection using Arduino from Python

This lab shifts control to the computer. The Arduino acts as a receiver, waiting for single-letter commands ('R', 'G', 'B', 'A') to toggle specific LEDs. While the Python Script provides a menu on your computer screen for you to select which LED to turn on, demonstrating how external software can control hardware.
